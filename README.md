Recommended for those looking for an alternative to the [discontinued](https://blog.chromium.org/2016/08/from-chrome-apps-to-web.html) Google Chrome / [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium) App mode, but consider [Atom Electron](https://electronjs.org) or [NW.js](https://nwjs.io) too much for their projects and look for a minor GNU / Linux solution.
